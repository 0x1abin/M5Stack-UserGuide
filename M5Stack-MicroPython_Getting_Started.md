***MacOS/Linux***
**1. Check port on Linux and MacOS**

  To check the device name for the serial port of your M5Stack board (or external converter dongle), run this command two times, first with the board / dongle unplugged, then with plugged in. The port which appears the second time is the one you need:

  Linux

  ```
  ls /dev/tty*
  ```
  
  MacOS

  ```
  ls /dev/cu.*
  ```


**2. Adding user to `dialout` on Linux**

The currently logged user should have read and write access the serial port over USB. On most Linux distributions, this is done by adding the user to `dialout` group with the following command:

  ```
  sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
  ```
Now, my serial port named `ttyUSB0`
